# scribble_tunes_demo

Scribble tunes is a Node.js library that allows you to make MIDI files using Node.js. I'm going to run a few example scripts that create different types of MIDI files. To start, I'm going to make a song in C# major. It will be fairly simple. A chord pattern, a bassline, and an arp.

Installing Scribble Tune with npm (npm install scribbletune) is required for this project
